Go to File - Preferences - Configure User Snippets

Dropdown will appear. Select New Global Snippets file and type <any-name> you want and hit enter

File should be created with the following name <any-name>.code-snippet

Paste this code. Anything you type in prefix will be your component trigger

{
	"React Functional Component": {
	  "prefix": "rfc",
	  "body": [
		"import './${TM_FILENAME_BASE}.scss';",
		"",
		"interface ${TM_FILENAME_BASE}Props {}",
		"",
		"const ${TM_FILENAME_BASE}: React.FC<${TM_FILENAME_BASE}Props> = ({}) => {",
		"  return <div></div>;",
		"};",
		"",
		"export default ${TM_FILENAME_BASE};",
		""
	  ],
	  "description": "React Functional Component with SCSS Import"
	}
  }
  

Save the file

Type (in this case) rfc and hit enter.
